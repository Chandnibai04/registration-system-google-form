# Google Form Registration System

This is an automated registration system built using:

- Google Forms (for user registration)
- Google Sheets (for storing responses)
- Google Apps Script (for sending confirmation emails)

## 📋 How It Works

1. User fills out a Google Form (Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
2. Data is sent to Google Sheet.
3. A trigger runs a Google Apps Script that:
   - Extracts email from the latest form response
   - Sends a confirmation email to the user

## 🚀 Benefits

- Reduces manual data entry
- Automates confirmation emails
- Centralized data collection in Google Sheets
- Avoids errors in spelling or missed messages
